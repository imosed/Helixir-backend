Platform used to share cocktail recipes (backend only)

This is only an API to allow users to put together cocktail recipes. The frontend will be coming shortly and it will use Angular to interface with this.

Currently, the API allows the user to filter by name, has the capability to allow people to increase scores on drinks, and put together drink recipes.
